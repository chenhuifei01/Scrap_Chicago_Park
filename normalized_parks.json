     "history": "\n        \n        The Chicago Park District acquired the site of Abbott Park as part of a ten-year plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served neighborhoods in post-World War II Chicago. \u00a0In 1947, the Citizens Advisory Committee on Park Sites recommended the creation of a park to serve the rapidly growing African-American community near 95th Street and Michigan Avenue. \u00a0The Park District purchased the property southeast of that intersection in 1949 and 1950, and built a swimming pool and recreational facility the following year. \u00a0In 1956, the District sold a portion of the parkland to the Board of Education for use as Harlan High School.Robert Sengstacke Abbott (1868-1940), for whom the park is named, founded the influential Chicago Defender in 1905. \u00a0Born in Georgia, Abbott received his education in southern schools, and graduated from Chicago's Kent College of Law. \u00a0He was the only African-American in the class of 1899. \u00a0Abbott's lofty goal was to eliminate racial prejudice through his newspaper. \u00a0To promote racial equality, Abbott and his Chicago Defender newspaper urged southern blacks to migrate to Chicago and other northern cities for greater economic opportunity. \u00a0By 1918, the influential newspaper had a national circulation of 125,000, making it the largest-selling black newspaper in the country. \u00a0President of his Abbott Publishing Company, Abbott was also active in civic affairs.\u00a0 He served on Governor Frank O. Lowden's Race Relations Committee in 1919, on the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago World's Fair in 1934, and on the boards of the Art Institute, the Field Museum, and the Chicago Historical Society. \n        \n        ",

Initially, acquisition began in 1930.\u00a0 Acquisition to expand the park was finalized in 1955; streets and alleys were vacated in 1957 to complete the 16.65-acre park.\u00a0 The park was the last of those developed by the Calumet Park District, established in 1903. The Calumet Park District was one of 22 neighborhood park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. By 1931, Ada Park had a swimming pool and a few landscape improvements. After the Chicago Park District took control of the park in 1934, other recreational facilities were installed. The Park District erected a new bathhouse for the swimming pool in 1940, and built \"fieldhouse additions\" to the bathhouse in 1957 and 1990.Until 1934, Ada Park was known as Loomis Street Park, for the street running along its west side. Late in that year, the Calumet Park District voted to change the name to Ada Park, for the street on the park's opposite side. The street is named for Ada Sawyer Garrett (1856-1938), who sold the last remaining vacant land in the Logan Square neighborhood, the Logan Square Ball Park, to developers in 1924. Though the Chicago Park District informed the Calumet Park District that it had no authority to rename the site Ada Park, the name has been used ever since. \n        \n        ",

Placed under the jurisdiction of the City's Special Park Commission, on which George Adams served, Adams Park had playground apparatus, a shelter house, and sand court as early as 1904. In 1910, the Adamses conveyed title to the property to the City. By 1916, the Special Park Commission had added a playing field that was flooded in winter for ice skating. The City transferred Adams Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In 1997, a new interactive waterplay area, named for retired school teacher Dorothy Melamerson, opened in Adams Park. Ms. Melamerson provided funding for the children's water feature through a bequest in her will. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In 1881, the City of Chicago acquired a triangular property in Greater Grand Crossing from the community's original developer, Paul Cornell. A quarter-century later, renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen, a member of the City's Special Park Commission, reported that the triangle had deteriorated into \"a truck garden in a mud hole, surrounded by ditches...into which the sewage emptied.\" He further described it as \"the site of a dog pound, with other sorry-looking shacks for ornament, all bordered by a rotten plank walk on two sides.\" In 1907, Jensen began improving the site with proper drainage, substantial walks, trees, and shrubbery. In subsequent years, the Commission seeded the lawns, planted additional trees, and installed a drinking fountain. Between the early 1920s and the mid-1940s, the depressed lawn was flooded in winter for ice skating. In 1957, the City transferred Adams Park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District has maintained it as a greenspace for passive recreation ever since. The origin of the Adams Park name is unclear. Hyde Park historian Steve Treffman believes the park may have been named for John C. Adams, an official of the Cornell Watch Company, which stood across 76th Street from the park around 1900. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        Between 1914 and 1916, the City created a municipal pier and a neighboring park by filling in submerged land east of Lake Shore Drive and north of Grand Avenue. The new municipal pier was almost immediately pressed into service as a naval training site during World War I, and in 1927, the city renamed the structure Navy Pier in honor of the trainees. The adjacent park also took the new name.Navy Pier Park, like other City parks was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In 1996, the Park District officially re-designated the park Jane Addams Memorial Park in honor of the world-renowned social reformer and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Addams founded one of North America's first settlement houses, Chicago's Hull House, which provided much-needed social services and cultural opportunities to its near west side immigrant neighborhood. Addams also worked tirelessly to promote various legal reforms, including the first juvenile-court law and an eight-hour working day for women.A six-piece sculptural grouping honoring Addams by Louise Bourgeois called \"Helping Hands\" was originally installed at Addams Memorial Park. Unfortunately, the sculptures were severely vandalized and had to be removed. \"Helping Hands\" was later restored and relocated to Chicago Women's Park and Gardens where it continues to serve as a monument to Addams' work in Chicago.\u00a0 \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In the late 1940s, Addams Park's Near West Side neighborhood was decaying and congested. The Chicago Park District established the much-needed park in 1946, part of a ten-year plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served neighborhoods after World War II.Land acquisition proved problematic, however, and demolition of the site's dilapidated buildings did not begin until 1952. The Chicago Park District acquired the majority of the land for the park from 1952 until 1954.\u00a0 In 2020, the Chicago Park District added a new fieldhouse to the park.The park's name honors Jane Addams (1860-1935), the world-renowned social reformer who devoted her life to serving the economic and social needs of the Near West Side's disadvantaged immigrant community. Addams' base of operations was her Hull House on nearby Halsted Street, one of North America's first settlement houses. In addition to her work in Chicago, Addams actively promoted national legal reforms, including tenement-house regulation, factory inspection, and workers' compensation. Addams was awarded the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts. \n        \n        ",

For many years, the property was known as Washtenaw Park, presumably for the street on which it is located. In 1999, the Park District changed the park's name to Algonquin to avoid confusion with a second Washtenaw Park located on Chicago's south side. The Algonquins were a large family of Native American tribes linked by language. At one time, the Algonquins occupied territory extending from the east coast to the Rocky Mountains, a larger area of North America than any other Native American group. A number of Algonquin tribes lived in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. These included the Menominee, Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Potowatomi, and Miami. \n        \n        ",

The Calumet Park District took control of the water works site in 1920, but never improved it. The property was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 The Park District officially named the tiny greenspace Almond Park in 1974. The park was one of a number of properties named for trees and plants at this time. The ancient almond tree, mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, had its origins in China. The tree produces the world's most popular nut. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        Amundsen Park is among the thirteen parks created by the Northwest Park District. The Northwest Park District began to purchase land for the park in 1925, on the recommendation of its Committee on Park Sites. By 1928, the Northwest Park District completed the land acquisition for the park and the North Austin Community Club was urging speedy improvement of the property. Before the end of that year, the Park District had acquired the remainder of the park's 13.33 acres, contracted for playground equipment, and approved fieldhouse plans. By 1931, some improvements had been made, but a plea by the North Austin Manor Neighborhood Club to move ahead with the fieldhouse could not be honored due to the District's financial condition. \u00a0The Northwest Park District designated the park Roald Amundsen Park in 1933; two years after rejecting a petition to name the park for Norwegian-born football coach Knute Rockne (1888-1931). The Norwegian National League suggested the Amundsen name as a way to honor Norwegian polar adventurer Roald Amundsen (1872-1928). Amundsen led many scientific explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic, but is best known for discovering the South Pole on December 4, 1911. In 1928, Amundsen's plane disappeared near the North Pole as he led a search for a missing Italian dirigible.In 1934, the Northwest Park District was one of the 22 park districts that were consolidated into the Chicago Park District, and Amundsen Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District eventually constructed the Amundsen Park fieldhouse in 1954. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In 2008, the City of Chicago acquired just over one acre of property at 16th St. and Wabash Ave. to provide parkland within a redeveloped area of the Near South Side Community Area. The City of Chicago transferred the park to the Chicago Park District in 2015. The Chicago Park District took over the design, development, and management of the park.Park District staff members and Altamanu, a landscape architecture and urban planning firm, worked closely with community members to create plans for the park. It includes a dog friendly area, lawn, trees and benches, as well as a stage area with a seating wall for performances by musicians and other local artists.In 2011, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners named the new park in honor of Fred Anderson an internationally acclaimed jazz musician who lived only a few blocks away from 2101 South Michigan Avenue and in close proximity to the original site of the Velvet Lounge, Anderson\u2019s bar that became known as one of Chicago\u2019s most important jazz venues.\u00a0 Born in Monroe, Louisiana Fred Anderson (1929 \u2013 2010) began teaching himself to play the piano at the age of five and took up the tenor saxophone as a teenager. He married in 1950, worked various odd jobs to support his family, and played the saxophone in his spare time. Although he did not play professionally until he was in his thirties, audiences and other musicians quickly recognized his great talent.In the mid 1960s, Anderson was one of the original Chicago members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. He and his band played in the first AACM concert. Anderson soon made a recording, \u201cSong For\u201d on Delmark Records, which proved to be the first of more than thirty albums he recorded. Around this time, he became known as the \u201cLone Prophet of the Prairie,\u201d in part because of the fact he played with such a unique and distinctive style.Making his first trip to perform in Europe in 1977, Anderson gained quick popularity, travelling and performing throughout the US as well as Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland. Despite his widespread fame, he maintained strong ties with Chicago. In 1982, he began to help a sick friend run the Velvet Lounge at 2128 \u00bd South Indiana Avenue. When his friend died, Anderson took over the bar and transformed it into internationally renowned venue for creative music.Fred Anderson mentored many younger musicians, performed at numerous Chicago Jazz Festivals, and contributed to the vitality of Chicago for decades. He was always true to his motto of \u201cpatience, sincerity, and consistency.\u201d \n        \n        ",

The Park District rehabilitated the playground in 1964, and again in 1992. \u00a0Known for years as Ashland Playlot for the adjacent street, the property was officially renamed Andersonville Park in 1993, at the request of neighborhood residents.\u00a0 Andersonville Park is named for the Andersonville section of the Edgewater Community Area. The neighborhood began to develop rapidly in the early 1900\u2019s, when the City's elevated trains first reached the area. Around World War I, large numbers of Swedish immigrants moved north to Andersonville from earlier \"Swede Towns\" on Chicago's Near North Side and Lake View Community Areas. After World War II, many early Andersonville residents moved on to the Rogers Park Community Area and northern suburbs, but the community still celebrates its Swedish heritage with ethnic shops and restaurants, and a Swedish American museum. \n        \n        ",

The City of Chicago acquired Arcade Park in 1910. George Pullman vastly improved the comfort of long distance rail travel when he introduced the sleeping car that bears his name. In 1877, George Pullman began to purchase 3,500 acres on the western shore of Lake Calumet on which to build his new Pullman Palace Car Works. In 1880, he began construction of the enormous plant and surrounding company town. Pullman hired architect Solon S. Beman to design the town's buildings and Nathan F. Barrett to plan the landscape. The designers placed Arcade Park, with its formal \"carpet bed\" plantings, directly opposite the Arcade, an enormous iron and glass structure housing shops, a post office, a library, and a theater. Though its namesake park remains, the impressive building was demolished in 1926. The City transferred Arcade Park to the Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. \n        \n        ",

The new park was part of a ten-year, district-wide program to increase recreational opportunities in underserved neighborhoods in post-World War II Chicago. Archer Park provided solely outdoor recreational facilities until 1970, when the Park District constructed a small fieldhouse. \n        \n        ",

     "description": "\n        \n        Located in the Armour Square Community Area, Armour Square Park totals 8.98 acres. Many Chicagoans know Armour Square as the park across the street from the Chicago White Sox stadium. The fieldhouse features a fitness center, two gymnasiums and an auditorium, along with meeting rooms.Outside, the park offers junior and senior baseball fields, an athletic field for football and soccer, tennis courts, a playground and an outdoor pool. The playground was renovated in Fall 2013 as part of the Chicago Plays! playground initiative. Many of these spaces are available for rental.Park-goers come to Armour Square for baseball or volleyball or to exercise in the fitness center. After school programs are offered throughout the school year, and in the summer youth attend the Park District\u2019s popular six-week day camp. In addition to programs, Armour Square Park hosts fun special events throughout the year for the whole family, such as egg hunts, holiday parties and Movies in the Park. \n        \n        ",
     "history": "\n        \n        The South Park Commissioners acquired the land for this park in 1904.\u00a0 Development of the park included a fieldhouse, with four clubrooms, two gymnasiums, an assembly hall, and large lobby.\u00a0 Outdoor amenities such as lawns, walks, and plantings were installed and recreational facilities included an outdoor swimming pool, baseball and football fields, handball and tennis courts, and a children\u2019s playground.\u00a0 The development was completed in 1905 and there was a dedication of the park that same year.\u00a0 In 1906, the year after Armour Square opened to the public, President Theodore Roosevelt described the square and nine other related properties as \"the most notable civic achievement in any American city.\" \u00a0The South Park Commission created the ten new innovative parks to improve the difficult living conditions in Chicago's congested tenement districts. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. designed the entire system.\u00a0 The South Park Commission was one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. The first ten included five squares smaller than ten acres in size, and five parks larger than ten acres. In addition to Armour Square, these were Mark White, Russell, Davis\u00a0and Cornell Squares, and Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, Bessemer and Hamilton Parks. These properties soon influenced the development of other parks throughout the nation.An ordinance was passed on August 17, 1904 to name the park Armour Square to honor Philip D. Armour (1832-1901), Chicago's \"captain of industry.\" Owner and operator of the largest meatpacking company in the world, Armour donated a large amount of his fortune to charitable and educational institutions. These included a settlement house, the Armour Mission, and a school known as the Armour Institute of Technology, later renamed the Illinois Institute of Technology. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        Arrigo Park, known as Vernon Park for much of its history, dates to 1859, when real estate developer Henry D. Gilpin donated the property to the City of Chicago. The City soon created a shaded \"breathing spot\" with an artificial lake and a few benches.In 1871, the modest residences surrounding Vernon Park fell to the flames of the Chicago Fire. Commercial institutions and transient rooming houses took their place. The park had deteriorated into a boggy mess as surrounding streets and structures were raised up to improve sewage removal and prevent flooding.When the City transferred control and maintenance of Vernon Park to the West Park Commission in 1885, rehabilitation began immediately. To alleviate the drainage problem, the Commission filled the artificial lake and raised the ground level of the entire site with additional fill. In 1893, the Commission undertook extensive landscape improvements and electrified the park. In 1934, with the consolidation of the 22 park districts into one, the Chicago Park District, Vernon Park came under the control and management of the new District. In 1957, the Chicago Park District acquired title to the property pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. \u00a0In 1972, the City of Chicago conveyed adjacent property to the Chicago Park District for expansion of the park. In 1974, Vernon Park was officially renamed Arrigo Park in honor of Victor Arrigo (1908-1973). A vocal advocate for the Italian-American community, Arrigo served as Illinois State Representative for Chicago's near southwest side from 1966 to 1973.Arrigo was instrumental in bringing sculptor Moses Ezekiel's statue of Christopher Columbus to the park in 1966. First exhibited in the Italian pavilion at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the bronze figure later graced a second-story alcove on State Street's Columbus Memorial Building.After the building came down in 1959, the statue went into storage. Arrigo argued that Columbus should find a new home in the City's oldest continuously Italian-American neighborhood, which was then experiencing wrenching transformation due to the construction of the University of Illinois' Circle Campus. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        Ashe Beach Park lies along Lake Michigan in Chicago's South Shore Community Area. The Chicago Park District purchased the park site in 1979 with the help of Community Development Block Grant funds, and developed the park during the 1980\u2019s through an Illinois Department of Conservation grant. In October 1993, the Park District officially designated the park Arthur Ashe Beach and Park in honor of tennis champion Arthur Ashe (1943-1993), who had died earlier that year of complications due to AIDS. The South Shore community believed that the name change would inspire young people to use the park.At the top of his tennis game, Ashe ranked No. 1 in the world and won three of four Grand Slam tournaments, the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, and the Australian Open. As captain of the Davis Cup team, he recorded 13 wins, leading the U.S. to consecutive victories in 1981 and 1982. Ashe also served as chairman of the Black Tennis and Sports Foundation, a non-profit group devoted to assisting black athletes and sports organizations. In addition, he was active in creating inner-city youth tennis camps in Chicago and elsewhere. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        Created by the Irving Park District, Athletic Field Park takes its name from the recreational facilities it provides. In 1923, Irving Park District began acquiring land in the southeastern part of its community, a lovely tree-lined neighborhood of apartment buildings, bungalows, and fine homes.\u00a0 The land acquisition for the park was completed the following year.\u00a0 Clarence Hatzfeld, architect of several nearby Villa District residences as well as many north- and northwest-side park fieldhouses, designed three structures for Athletic Field Park.\u00a0 Constructed in 1926, these included an attractive Spanish Revival-style fieldhouse, a smaller locker and game room building, and a children's playground shelter. The four-acre park also had an athletic field with grandstands, a junior baseball field, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box, and horseshoe and tennis courts. Four years after Athletic Field Park opened, due to a lack of use of the junior baseball field, and an increasing demand for tennis courts, the Commissioners replaced the ballfield area with additional tennis courts.Athletic Field Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s inventory in 1934, when the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the City's 22 independent park agencies. In the early 1960\u2019s, the Park District converted the park's locker and game room into a ceramics studio. In 1969, further improvements were made to the ceramics building, including the installation of additional kilns.\u00a0 Ceramics classes remain a popular program at Athletic Field Park. \n        \n        ",

This park offers a lagoon, a waterfall and benches. In this green space, popular activities park patrons and their families participate in are fishing and picnics. \n        \n        ",
     "history": "\n        \n        Created as part of a speculative real estate development, Auburn Park lies within an area once known as Cummorn. William B. Ogden, Chicago\u2019s first mayor and early real estate promoter, owned much of the property in this area. A marshy area, the land originally drained seven miles southeast into the Calumet River. The first railroad line was constructed in 1852, and by the early 1870s, three other railroads ran through the community. Railroad workers began building homes in the area, and in 1872, the Auburn settlement was platted. Eggleston Mallette, purchased the area in the 1870s and Brownell real estate speculators, who subdivided, drained, and began developing the land. Within several years, a second group of real estate developers, Sanford McKnight, Henry Mather and Alfred Manning, purchased the property. Sometime between the 1870s and 1890s, one of the two groups of developers created Auburn Park, an 8-acre landscape with a meandering lagoon, a remnant of the site's original wetlands. The park helped to establish the area as an attractive and desirable community. In 1887, the Auburn Park Subdivision created this private park.\u00a0 In 1889, the Auburn community was annexed with Chicago. The following year, the City began maintaining the park, although it was still privately owned. Local residents wanted the site to become a public park. Between 1911 and 1913, the Auburn Park Improvement Association acquired and transferred the park to the City. The deed included covenants requiring that the land will forever be used as a park; the park and lagoon will always be maintained; and the name Auburn Park will never be changed. Considered the \"beauty spot of Auburn,\" the park has long provided a calm refuge from the \"weary\" City. Auburn Park was transferred from the City to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The Chicago Department of Transportation restored the parks historic bridges in the late 1990s. \n        \n        ",

Augusta Boulevard apparently takes its name from Augusta Carpenter, daughter of Philo Carpenter (1805-1886), Chicago's first druggist. Carpenter traveled from Chicago to Troy, New York by mail coach and Indian canoe in 1832. Upon arrival, he opened a drug store near the river on what is now Lake Street. By 1834, he had made a fortune investing in real estate. Carpenter later became a vocal advocate of abolitionism and temperance, and served as a director of the Chicago Theological Seminary. The Chicago Park District has recognized Carpenter's role in the City's early history by naming another park for him. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In 1865, Henry W. Austin (1828-1889) purchased 280 acres of poorly drained prairie land in Cicero Township. Within the next few years, Austin subdivided the area, laid out streets, and planted trees, calling the new development Austinville. Twenty years later, in December 1885, Henry Austin and his wife Martha donated three large lots to the Town of Cicero for use as a public park.Austin Park became Chicago's responsibility in 1899, after the area was annexed to the City. In 1906, noted landscape architect and Special Park Commission member Jens Jensen drew up a plan for the long, narrow site along the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad embankment. The park's most notable landscape feature was a meandering lagoon, with boys' and girls' wading pools and a wooden bridge at one end, and small wooded islands at the other. In 1908, the Special Park Commission added a dressing room facility with a 10-foot pergola and electric lights for night swimming.The lagoon was heavily used from the first. In 1910, the Special Park Commission invited underprivileged children from the City's settlement houses to use the wading pools, providing them with free bathing suits. Fifty-five thousand children used the wading pools during the summer of 1915. By 1930, attendance had increased to nearly 90,000. In the wintertime, children also ice skated on the frozen lagoons.The City transferred Austin Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. By this time, the lagoon had deteriorated, and the Park District soon filled in the eastern section. At the lagoon's west end, the Park District transformed the boys' and girls' wading pools into a wading pool and spray pool, and constructed a new changing facility. In 1992, the Park District installed the first soft surface playground where the eastern portion of the lagoon once lay. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In 1934, the Board of Education acquired land at Austin and Foster Avenues, which would eventually become a park.\u00a0 As early as 1960, residents of the Jefferson Park Community Area expressed the need for a playground and softball field in their community. In 1965, the Chicago Park District began leasing an almost 5-acre site in the neighborhood owned by the Board of Education. Playground equipment and a ball diamond were installed the following year. In early 1991, the Board of Education formally transferred the site to the Chicago Park District, which promptly constructed a new soft surface playground. Installation of new trees and plantings followed in subsequent years. For nearly three decades, the site was known only as Park No. 285. In 1993, the Park District officially designated the property Austin-Foster Park, a name commonly used by area residents. The name makes reference to the two adjacent streets, Austin Avenue and Foster Avenue. Austin Boulevard recognizes Henry W. Austin (1828-1889), who purchased prairie land west of Chicago in 1865 and laid out the town of Austinville (later the City's Austin community) not long thereafter. Foster Avenue honors John H. Foster (1796-1874), a physician and landowner who arrived in Chicago around 1835. Foster served on both the Chicago and Illinois Boards of Education. \n        \n        ",

     "history": "\n        \n        In 1865, businessman and real estate speculator Henry W. Austin created a lovely 280-acre subdivision in Cicero Township. Austin's development included wide, tree-lined streets and a small park, originally known as Holden Park. The township selected Austin as its seat of government, and in 1870 constructed a brick town hall building, with a cupola and eclectic details, in the center of Holden Park.In 1898, residents of Austin, having a majority on Cicero's town council, used political influence to allow the extension of the Lake Street elevated line into their community. This infuriated residents of other areas within Cicero Township, such as Oak Park and Berwyn, who retaliated the following year by holding a joint election to force Austin's annexation to the City of Chicago. Much to the dismay of local residents, this effort succeeded and Austin became part of Chicago in 1899. The City took over the Cicero Town Hall and began using it as a library and police station as well as for other public functions.The City passed an ordinance that granted control of Holden Park to the West Park Commission in 1927. This was subject to a 99-year lease the City granted to the Chicago Public Library and also required the West Park Commissioner to build a community building in Holden Park. Because the old town hall had housed a branch library for several years, the West Park Commissioners agreed to the construction of a new public library in the park, designed by architect Alfred S. Alschuler. This public library is still operating today. At the same time, the West Park Commission also built a fieldhouse for the newly renamed Austin Town Hall Park. The large brick Georgian Revival-style building was influenced by Philadelphia's Independence Hall.\u00a0 The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable park buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Humboldt and Douglas Park Fieldhouses.\u00a0 The construction of the Austin Town Hall fieldhouse was completed in 1929.In 1934, with the Park Consolidation Act, the 22 park districts were merged into one, the Chicago Park District, and Austin Town Hall Park came under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Park District.\u00a0 The City transferred Austin Town Hall Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.  \n        \n        ",
